# Marika's Ping Pong test

#### Javascript BDD exercise for Epicodus, 01.22.2016

#### By Marika Allely

## Description

Similar to the fizzbuzz test, this web application takes a number from the user and returns a list of numbers up to the user input.  Anything divisible by three is replaced with the string "ping", anything divisible by five is replaced with the string "pong", and anything divisible by fifteen is replaced with the string "pingpong".  This application is an excercise in JS, jQuery, business logic, and UI logic.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Open index.html in your browser (Chrome is my favorite)
* Plug in numbers!

## Known Bugs

The function "validator" is supposed to return false if input is not a number, but it doesn't.  But!  It does return false for negative numbers, so that's neat.
